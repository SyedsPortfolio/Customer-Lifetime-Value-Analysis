# Definition
Customer lifetime value analysis is used to estimate the total value of customers to the business over the lifetime of their relationship. It helps companies determine how much to invest in customer acquisition and retention, as well as identify the most valuable customers to prioritize for retention efforts.

By analyzing customer lifetime value, companies can identify the most effective marketing channels and campaigns for acquiring high-value customers, as well as develop targeted retention strategies to keep those customers engaged and loyal.
